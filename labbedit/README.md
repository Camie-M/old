## :bookmark: About

**Labeddit** is a social network - it has login and sign up, a feed page and also a page with post details. Users can make a post and comment. There is an integration with a external API.

The project was made with a group, during the Full Stack Web Developer course from [Labenu](https://www.labenu.com.br/). It was my first project using Context API and Reducer.
