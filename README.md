## :bookmark: About

The current repository is made to keep my old projects, the first few development projects I ever did. Most were made in the first half of 2020.

I do not keep track if they still work and if the links are correct.

I could just delete them, but I do enjoy the idea of looking at them from time to time to think about how much my code changed.
